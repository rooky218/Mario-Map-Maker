# Mario-Map-Maker

<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/rooky218/ep7sbc6a/7/">Link to project</a>

Simple function based JS code (JS Vanilla) that builds a generic Super Mario level. Part of a class project to build a game, this was my contribution.

JS code renders onto a canvas in HTML, and the JS part uses functions to render out images over a grid. These functions are very dynamic with varios inputs that change the location, size, and type of block that is used. Changing any of the parameters can have a desired effect, thus making a map build easy once you know the functions
