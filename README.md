# Mario-Map-Maker

<a href="https://jsfiddle.net/rooky218/ep7sbc6a/7/">Link to project</a> -- If you click through this link, don't forget to scroll through the map. The canvas window is bigger than JSFiddle window, so if you don't see anything except the blue sky, scroll around

Simple function based JS code (pure JS) that builds a generic Super Mario level. Part of a class project to build a game, this was my contribution.

JS code renders onto a canvas in HTML, and the JS part uses functions to render out images over a grid. These functions are very dynamic with varios inputs that change the location, size, and type of block that is used. Changing any of the parameters can have a desired effect, thus making a map build easy once you know the functions
